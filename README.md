This is an alternative firmware for **FlySky i6** transmitters.
See below for the list of [features](#features) added
(including the [14 channels](https://github.com/qba667/FlySkyI6/wiki/14-channels) support, of course!)
and [hardware mods](#hardware-mods-supported) supported.

## Credits

The firmware is a modification of original FlySky firmware inspired
and based on work of _@ThomHpl_ and _Dave Borthwick_,
With use of repository created by
[@benb0jangles](https://github.com/benb0jangles/FlySky-i6-Mod-)
and input from _@povlhp_. Currently supported
and maintained by _@qba667_ with great input and improvements from _@Yenya_.

Including input from rcgroups users from the following thread:

[FlySky-FS-i6-8-channels-firmware-patch!](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?2486545-FlySky-FS-i6-8-channels-firmware-patch!)

The Turnigy TGY-CAT01 support could be implemented by by courtesy of *inode_* - thanks for providing of the sensor and huge amount of measurement and analysis made by cookieqk.
